# Sales_analysis-of-thousands-of-electronics-store

Just wrapped up a fascinating data analysis project using the power of Pandas in Python! 

In this Task I use Python Pandas & Matplotlib to analyze and answer the business questions. I delved into this fascinating dataset from a GitHub repository, exploring answer of the business questions about 12 months worth of sales data. 



I basically start by cleaning the data, this step includes dropping the NaN values,changing types of the columns, etc.



Then after clearing the data, I jumped to the data exploration part,

and have answered some of the Questions that was attached in the Github repository related to the best Product sold and which city has sold the most Product and many more....



I have answered these questions only by using Pandas and Matplotlib methods and created the graph charts also.

Ihave got this Dataset from-- https://github.com/KeithGalli/Pandas-Data-Science-Tasks/tree/master/SalesAnalysis
With the help of his youtube video I analysed and give answer of the Questions but using methods of pandas and matplotlib in my own manner..
